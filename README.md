mash
====

Generate build recipes based on catkin package manifest (package.xml)  [format 2](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0140.html).

It is a standalone application that uses the colcon extensions to discover packages in a workspace.  It then reads the package manifest to get the metadata needed to create the [BitBake](https://docs.yoctoproject.org/bitbake/) recipe.

# Why mash?

The ROS tooling has a naming scheme based on willow trees and the OpenEmbedded tools use a cooking theme. The name matches both schemes and also makes a convenient action verb for a command-line tool.

"Poor people at one time often ate willow catkins that had been cooked to form a mash." <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willow>

# Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/robwoolley/mash.git
cd mash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install colcon-common-extensions
pip install .
```

# Usage

If you already have a ROS 2 environment, you may skip to step 3.

1. Use Docker to pull the official ROS 2 Humble container image.

```
docker run -it --rm amd64/ros:humble
```

2. Install the package for Python venv support:
```
apt update
apt install -y python3.10-venv
```

3. Create a workspace with mash with some demonstration examples.

```
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
mkdir -p ~/ros2_ws/src
cd ~/ros2_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials.git -b humble
git clone https://github.com/ros2/demos.git -b humble
cd ..
```

4. Install mash with venv
```
git clone https://github.com/robwoolley/mash.git
cd mash
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install colcon-common-extensions
pip install .
cd ..
```

5. Run mash in the colcon workspace to create BitBake recipes.
```
mash --rosdistro $ROS_DISTRO
```

6. Find the generated bitbake recipes under build_mash:
```
(myenv) root@25037274df1a:~/ros2_ws# find build_mash -type f

build_mash/dummy_map_server/dummy-map-server_0.20.7.bb

```

6. (Optional) If mash fails to find any ROS packages, you may try building the colcon workspace to see if colcon can discover the packages.

```
rosdep install -i --from-path src --rosdistro humble -y
colcon build
```
